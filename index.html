  <h1>Hello my name is Zach</h1>
  <p>
    A few things about me:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before here, I worked at Teleperformance.</li>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Successes</h2>
  <h4>8/16/19</h4>
  <p>So for, I have been doing fairly well at grasping the concepts of the code that has been provided. I am
    understanding the logic flows of javascript and am able to work my way through most of the presented problems so
    far, although, it may take some time and research to accomplish it.</p>
  <h2>Struggles</h2>
  <h4>8/16/19</h4>
  <p>I have had some struggles fully grasping the implementation of classes and objects, especially when it comes to
    arrays.</p>
  <h2>Looking forward to...</h2>
  <h4>8/16/19</h4>
  <p>I am definitely looking forward to understnding more about javascript and how to better use it to make pages
    dynamic. I am also looking forward to learning the new upcoming languages.</p>
